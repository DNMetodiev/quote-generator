## About

The Quote Generator is a simple, interactive web application designed to inspire users by randomly displaying quotes from a wide array of authors. It leverages a public API to fetch quotes and offers functionalities like generating new quotes and sharing them on Twitter(now known as X).

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases fundamental web development skills, focusing on asynchronous JavaScript for API requests.
